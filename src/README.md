## No Sleep Browser

A relatively simple web application built in python with the [Flask framework] (and some front-end stuff I guess).

The app produces random "horror" content from a list of "scary" subreddits. After digesting initial content,
the user has the option of browsing similar content (ie, from the same subreddit that was selected at random), or
experiencing a different, random subreddit (specifically, not the one that was just browsed).
